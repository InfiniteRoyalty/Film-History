                <p class="para">The Invention of Film was basically a science experiment for a lot of people involved with the advancement of the tools they used for cinema. Cinematography wasn’t invented by one person William Kennedy Laurie Dickson invented the main part of the Kinetoscope this was the world’s first projector it was used to show moving pictures, there was an eyepiece at the top of the contraption that allowed you to view the moving picture it was originally 20 seconds long, on a continuous loop. This device was manufactured in New Jersey, the first demonstration of this invention was in 1893. There were a place people could go to watch these 20 second films called “Kinetoscope Parlour” it was first opened in New York City in 1894, April 14th and in London October 18th, 1894. 
                    The Lumiere brothers invented a similar piece of technology called Cinématographe, which is basically a camera, printer and projector all in one. They were the first to show to the public for profit, in December 1895 in Paris, France. They were coined the “The Pioneers of Cinema and Colour Photography.” 
                    John Logie Baird invented the first video camera in the early 1900’s which is used to record moving pictures. Video cameras didn’t become iconic until the 1970’s. 
                    Why Film is an important medium, 
                    The answer is probably different for everyone, on a global scale film is a great way to document things, history art and memories. Film in general is a big part of everyone’s lives either way so it will always be significant.
