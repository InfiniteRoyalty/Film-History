Cinematography wasn’t invented by one person William Kennedy Laurie Dickson invented the main part of the Kinetoscope this was the world’s first projector it was used to show moving pictures, there was an eyepiece at the top of the contraption that allowed you to view the moving picture it was originally 20 seconds long, on a continuous loop. This device was manufactured in New Jersey, the first demonstration of this invention was in 1893. People would go watch these 20-second films called “Kinetoscope Parlour” it was first opened in New York City in 1894, on April 14th, and in London on October 18th, 1894.
                    The Lumiere brothers invented a similar piece of technology called Cinématographe, which is basically a camera, printer and projector all in one. They were the first to show to the public for profit, in December 1895 in Paris, France. They were coined the “The Pioneers of Cinema and Colour Photography.”
                    John Logie Baird invented the first video camera in the early 1900’s which is used to record moving pictures. Video cameras didn’t become iconic until the 1970’s.
